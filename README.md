# Maximum Entropy in Hawaii

*Testing the maximum entropy theory of ecology across the hawaiian chronosequence*

The maximum entropy theory of ecology seeks to build a statistical model of macroecology using the same principle that generates equilibrial predictions in statistical mechanics.  In this project I apply this theory to an extensive dataset of arthropods communities sampled across the chronosequence of the Hawaiian Islands.  This chronosequence offers a unique eco-evolutionary natural laboratory to study the process of community assembly by immigration, adaptation, speciation, and extinction.  In the context of testing statistical biodiversity theory, I'm interesting in understanding if the unique hysteresis produced by the process of rapid evolution in an insular system drives communities away from their statistical equilibrium into interesting, biologically-driven transient states.
